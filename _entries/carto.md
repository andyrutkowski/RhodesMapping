CARTO has been chosen for this workshop as an example of a simple exploratory mapping platform. What I mean by this is that many researchers do not need the full functionality and performance of desktop mapping software like ArcGIS or QGIS. They need a fast and intuitive platform in order to see data or perhaps do simple analysis. CARTO is probably the best platform available to quickly introduce students to the essentials of web mapping.
