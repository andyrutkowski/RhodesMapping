CARTO has been chosen for this workshop as an example of a simple exploratory mapping platform. What I mean by this is that many researchers do not need the full functionality and performance of desktop mapping software like ArcGIS or QGIS. They need a fast and intuitive platform in order to see data or perhaps do simple analysis. CARTO is probably the best platform available to quickly introduce students to the essentials of web mapping.

A slide deck has been created that provides a step-by-step tutorial and walkthrough of how to piece together the example map. It is broken up into different sections. The CARTO section walks you through adding several layers of data. The deck then pauses and sends you to the Mapbox section where you create a tileset of historical map. Once this is completed you go back to CARTO and eventually add it as a base layer.
