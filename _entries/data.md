Each database contains unique variables, historical date ranges, and varying geographic boundaries. There is considerable overlap when it comes to core data, such as population counts. However, each database has strengths and areas of data that the others do not cover.  

One of the most important features that each database provides is easy access to metadata for each variable. The metadata provides valuable information about specific variables as well as more information about the source of the data, for example, who gathered it, when, why, and how.
