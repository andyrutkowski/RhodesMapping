So now you have a project. How can put the pieces together? The GitHub model is meant to be an exploratory one. This is NOT about long term preservation and access. It is better than many other short term fixes though and it provides a solid basis for thinking about taking a project to the next level. That said some organizations and individuals have used GitHub for providing access to select data, project work, and other materials.

Lets walk though GitHub and see how you can use a GitHub repository to put your digital project together and make it accessible to the world.

GitHub is flexible and allows for some very interesting use cases - especially in terms of teaching, collaborating, and sharing projects.
