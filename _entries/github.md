GitHub is the final piece of this workshop. GitHub is not necessarily a mapping platform. There is support through Jekyll for making map posts and there are a few great examples of how to make limited, but very interactive maps. 

For this workshop though GitHub is more about creating a space to help you manage a project and share it. 

This GitHub model is meant to be an exploratory one. This is NOT about long term preservation and access. It is better than many other short term fixes though and it provides a solid basis for thinking about taking a project to the next level. That said some organizations and individuals have used GitHub for providing access to select data, project work, and other materials.
