GitHub is the final piece of this workshop. GitHub is not necessarily a mapping platform. There is support through Jekyll for making map posts and there are a few great examples of how to make limited, but very interactive maps. 

For this workshop though GitHub is more about creating a space to help you manage a project and share it. 

This GitHub model is meant to be an exploratory one. This is NOT about long term preservation and access. It is better than many other short term fixes though and it provides a solid basis for thinking about taking a project to the next level. That said some organizations and individuals have used GitHub for providing access to select data, project work, and other materials.

* [Example of a QGIS Tutorial](https://github.com/mltConsEcol/QGIS-Tutorial)

For this workshop I have created a GitHub repository that has some data as well as some sample html. Using GitHub you can publish this html code and create different maps. 

Everyone will fork this GitHub repoository and be able to adapt and use it for their own purposes.
