This workshop has several goals:

- Participants will gain a basic understanding of how and when to use SimplyAnalytics, Social Explorer, and PolicyMap  

- Participants will learn about what data is available via these databases, including historical coverage, topics, and geographic coverage  

- Participants will create simple maps exploring issues relevant to Los Angeles


Through this workshop we will not only build skills and competencies that will help to support this type of scholarship but we will also help to become part of a community of practice that emphasizes a critical approach to mapping and cartography.
