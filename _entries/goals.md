This workshop aims to facilitate a conversation between participants about how we can best engage and support researchers who are intereseted in creating and using digital maps in their work in some way. In some cases researchers want to explore materials in a spatially oriented research environment that enables them to ask questions about people and places. Other researchers may also want to share these results and make them accessible online to different communities. Beyond which tools can help researchers accomplish these goals it is also important to engage with them about all aspects of this process, from data management to thinking about the ethics of which platforms they use and how they visualize their data.  

Through this workshop we will not only build skills and competencies that will help to support this type of scholarship but we will also help to become part of a community of practice that emphasizes a critical approach to mapping and cartography.
