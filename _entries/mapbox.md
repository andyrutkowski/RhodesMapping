OK. So now you want to bring in a historical map and overlay it alongside your CARTO data. But how?! You don't have access to a server and you are not an experienced coder (yet).

MapBox and CARTO provide a simple solution that can get you started on the road to developing more and more complex and richly detailed maps.

Sign into MapBox. Very powerful software but we will only focus on a couple of things today. Bringing in a tiff file and creating a tileset. Then we will take that tileset and add it to a "style." This style will then be brought back into Carto.

Pick one of the historical maps:
