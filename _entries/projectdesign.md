What makes a good project? The easiest answer is a meaningful question or inquiry. For this workshop we will use Los Angeles as our site of analysis.

A couple of great examples of a digital mapping projects are South Carolina's Green Book project and the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond American Panorama Project:

[Green Book project](http://library.sc.edu/digital/collections/greenbook.html)
[American Panorama Project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/)

We will use these projects as starting points and attempt to recreate them on a smaller more local level.

For this example project we want to learn more about the history of Los Angeles through the lens of the GreenBook. We will use the following data to build out our project:

a dataset created by pulling data from the GreenBook
georeferenced historical maps of Los Angeles
Los Angeles Times neighborhood boundary data
Historical HOLC (Insurance map) boundary and rating data
Using these datasets we will create a digital project that will let us explore Los Angeles and provide opportunities for meaningful engagement, interpretation, discovery, and critical thinking.
