Think about someplace in Los Angeles that you would like to learn more about. Now think about some questions that you would like to explore. Chances are that one or more of these databases will help you begin the process of answering that question.  

In particular, these databases help to make visible data about people and places through themetic maps. Maps that tell you something about a place.

They generally show this information by displaying data within certain geographic boundaries - country, state, county, census tract, etc. The way that the data is gathered and prepared determines whether or not it can be shared at certain geographic levels. For most research, it is ideal to get the smallest geographic unit available in order to most accurately describe the relationship between the data and the place. Census tracts typically provide a good starting point but with some data it will not be available.  

As you move forward through your research take the time to learn as much as you can about your data. Each database provides ways for you to learn more about how the data was gathered and why it was gathered.
