What makes for a good project? 

Good projects are meaningful and impactful. They make you stop and ask questions. A digital project provides a way to directly communicate that meaning and impact.

Two model projects that have helped to inform this workshop are South Carolina's Green Book project and the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond American Panorama project:

[Green Book project](https://delphi.tcl.sc.edu/library/digital/collections/greenbook.html)

[American Panorama Project](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/)

These two projects take existing archival materials, process them so they can be made accessible online, and do so in a seamless way so that individuals can interact, learn, and ask questions through them. 

We will use these projects as starting points and attempt to recreate them on a local level.

For this example project we want to learn more about the history of Los Angeles through the lens of the GreenBook. We will use data that will create points for where Greenbook establishments existed, boundaries from the Homeowner's Loan Corporation, current neigbhorhood boundaries, and an image overlay of historical maps including the HOLC map. This data provides a great introduction to different types of geospatial data and important geospatial processes including geocoding, georeferencing, and spatial joins. 

Through these datasets we will create a digital project that will let us explore Los Angeles and provide opportunities for meaningful engagement, interpretation, discovery, and critical thinking. Moreover, the project is replicable and can be adapted to other cities and communities.
