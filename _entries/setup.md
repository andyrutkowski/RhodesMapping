We will be using 3 different tools during this workshop - CARTO, MapBox, and GitHub. In the past few years most mapping platforms have either moved towards a subscription model or made it more difficult to use their platforms freely. Platforms, such as ArcGIS Online or Google My Maps, while free tend to become problematic with respect to how they store data and provide access to it. Another great option that we will not be utilizing in this workshop and that could easily replace CARTO is Tableau. 

CARTO - Free for students and researchers
* [CARTO 30 Day free sign up](https://carto.com/signup/)  

MapBox - Limited free account for everyone. For research purposes it will likely be more than enough for almost any project.

GitHub - Free for everyone
* [GitHub sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
