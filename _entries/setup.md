We will be using 3 different tools during this workshop - CARTO, MapBox, and GitHub. In the past few years most mapping platforms have either moved towards a subscription model or made it more difficult to use their platforms freely. Platforms, such as ArcGIS Online or Google My Maps, while free tend to become problematic with respect to how they store data and provide access to it. Another great option that we will not be utilizing in this workshop and that could easily replace CARTO is Tableau. 

* CARTO free for students and researchers

[Free 30 days of CARTO sign up](https://carto.com/signup/) After you create a CARTO account you will be able to apply for an ambassador or a researcher account. For those who already have projects in CARTO you can make the request to become an ambassador or researcher. For new users to CARTO after this workshop you will be able to point to this project as an example of your work. Researchers or Ambassadors get special CARTO accounts with features and larger data storage. According to CARTO "to qualify, you must be an individual working on non-commercial projects and having a considerable impact in your community."

* MapBox - Limited free account for everyone. For research purposes it will likely be more than enough for almost any project.
