Social Explorer is most well known for providing access to the Census, both current and historical. In fact, Social Explorer allows you to go back and look at data from 1790. Because of this it is a great tool for learning more about the history of the United States Census as you can easily see what variables are recorded each year.

What is unique about this database?  

Social Explorer arguably produces the most visually appealing maps of these three platforms. It also has the ability to create side by side and swipe map views, which allow for greater interactivity. Lastly, a PowerPoint style storytelling feature allows for you to easily build out a narrative that you can use to explore topics.
